This holds static copies of notebooks for the [PyGaggle](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle), a neural IR and QA toolkit.
There are two ways to play with the notebooks here, using Colab and Binder.

## Colab

The notebooks in this repo are sync'ed (by hand) with notebooks in Colab.
These online demos provide a low-effort way to try out PyGaggle's features:
